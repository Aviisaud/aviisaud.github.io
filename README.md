# Flask Webpage Exercise

This project is a simple exercise to practice creating a basic webpage using Flask, a Python web framework. The webpage includes a header with a background video, a navigation bar, a body content section, and a footer. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to set up a basic Flask application, render HTML templates, serve static files such as CSS and video, and structure a webpage using HTML and Bootstrap.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Flask if you haven't already: `pip install Flask`.
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the webpage.

## Contents

- `app.py`: The Flask application file.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the webpage.
- `static/styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `static/future-video.mp4`: The background video file for the header.

## Disclaimer

This project is purely for educational purposes and serves as an exercise to practice pushing and pulling code from GitHub. It does not represent a fully-fledged web application and may lack certain features and optimizations found in real-world projects.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this project to further your learning and experimentation with Flask and web development in general.
